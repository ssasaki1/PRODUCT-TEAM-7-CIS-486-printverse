# Team Meeting Notes & Logs - Printverse

## Purpose
This document serves as the central log for all team meetings — planning, standups, retrospectives, and milestone reviews.  
Every meeting entry captures the discussion summary, decisions made, and action items assigned to each member.  
It helps maintain accountability and traceable progress throughout the project lifecycle.
