# Value Chain & Knowledge Management Analysis

## Problem Addressed

Modern teams waste hours each semester on repetitive, manual printer management—checking device status, recovering failed jobs, or searching for lost printouts. These inefficiencies are rarely tracked, preventing improvement and leading to unnecessary frustration and resource waste.

## Value Creation (Before/After)

| Step                  | Before Printverse                         | After Printverse                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Print Job Submission  | Manual, may require in-person action      | Automated, from any device      |
| Job Status Check      | Manually poll printer or ask teammates    | Live dashboard & notifications  |
| Missing Printouts     | Risk of loss or unclaimed documents       | Audit trail & alert on completion|
| Usage Analysis        | Team guesswork, no objective analytics    | Data dashboard, trend insights  |

## How Value is Measured

- **Primary Metric:** Time saved per job and per member per week.
- **Usage Analytics:** Logs and exposes redundant actions eliminated.
- **Satisfaction:** User survey scores post-implementation.

## Knowledge Management (KM) Flow

- Tacit knowledge (silent frustration, unwritten “workarounds”) becomes explicit via error/event logs and data dashboards.
- Product’s design enables process improvement based on actual usage data, not personality or anecdote.
- Creates feedback loop: Metrics → Insights → Team Habits → Product Evolution

## Impact

- *Quantifiable reduction* in wasted hours, print re-tries, and resource overuse
- *Making invisible pain visible* results in stakeholder buy-in and process change
